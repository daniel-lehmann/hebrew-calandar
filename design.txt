Name: hebrew calandar

Fundemental purpose of code project.

1. Create a calendar that will show a month view of a calandar with hebrew calandar side by side
2. Create tools that will enable getting stats about the hewbrew calcandar e.g. what is the earliest pesach ever was
3. The project has to be able to be deployed to a free server provide. e.g. google app or like firebase.
4. The project has to be esily viewed locally be opening the base html file

Expansion:
1. 
Create the app in html.
Create clean html CSS JS and HTML
Use vanilla JS
For JS:
	1. Define an 'api' module that can read from server if needed
	2. Define a 'view' layer that will handle rendering
	3. render HTML on client server can pass only templates and data
	4. keep files small and self contained not one long files
	5. keep functions testable and create tests for these functions and create the infrastructurer for testing
	6. test the correctness of functions and reiterate if you fails tests
For CSS:
	1. keep it nice and simple
	2. you can copy a design that looks nice not cluttered
	
How it should look:
	1. you should see a month of calcandar
	2. each cell should have the data and the hebrerw date

Month names with day count:
[Tishrey: 30,

Adar: 29,
Nisan: 30,
Iyar: 29,
Sivan: 30,
Tammuz: 29,
Av: 30,
Elul: 29]
Adar2: 30 is added after Adar on leap years.

Leap years:
on years 3,6,8,11,14,17,19 of the cycle we add Adar2

we decide year of the cycle by (year-1)%19 + 1 

Heshvan and Kislev day count are decided by:
Computing 'Molad_Tishrey' (tishrey new moon).

epoch: Molad_Tishrey for year 5786 was at 22/9/2025 18 hours + 187/1080
Computing molad tishrey of any year:
Count the number of months that have passed (each cycle is 12*19+7 and then add the extra years perhaps cretae a lookup for the 19 year of the cycle with the months up until then)

month_length = 29 Days 12 Hours + 793/1080 of an hour.
Then compute month_count * month_lenngth that is Molad_Tishrey of the required year
Tishrey 1 will be on the day of the molad. We can postpone it (never have it on the previous day) with the next 4 rules:
A. Tishrey 1 will not be on Sunday, WednesDay, Friday
B. If the Molad_Tishrey is after 18 hours postpone Tishrey 1
C. If the Molad_Tishrey is on monday 15 hours 589/1080 of an hour and the previous year was a leap yea postpone Tishrey 1
D. If the Molad_Tishrey is on tuesday 9 hours 204/1080 of an hour on a non leap year postpone Tishrey 1

If you have to postpone Tishrey 1 twice to have these rules e.g. after rules 2-4 Tishrey 1 is on sunday then do it.

Once you know Tishrey 1 of year i and year i+1 you know how many days there are in the year.
1. Day count 353 or 383 -> Heshvan, Kislev both 29 days.
2. Day count 354 or 384 -> Heshvan29 days, Kislev 30 days.
3. Day count 355 or 385 -> Heshvan, Kislev both 30 days.


2. Stats
I want to be able to answer questions like:
When is the earliest pesach in the last 2000 years.
Give me the dates of tishrey 1 for the last 2000 years.
Give me a histogram on what day of the week was tishrey 1 in a year range

3. 
I need to be able to open it with a click on my machine simply opening the html file.

4.
I need a simple script to deploy this to a free online server so I can show my friends
