===========================================

rules for joining parashot:
[Vayakhel + Pekudei -> joined when year is short enough that separate readings would exceed available Sabbaths,

Tazria + Metzora -> joined in non-leap years,

Achrei Mot + Kedoshim -> joined in non-leap years,

Behar + Bechukotai -> joined in non-leap years,

Chukat + Balak -> joined when needed to avoid conflict with festival readings,

Matot + Masei -> joined when needed to ensure Devarim precedes Tisha B’Av properly,

Nitsavim + Vayelech -> joined when Rosh Hashanah falls on Thursday or Saturday (so there are fewer available Sabbaths before the new year)]

===============================================================

The first parasha is read on the saturday after sukot and the last is read on simchat torah

rules on what holidays the parasha is not read.

[Pesach (all festival days that fall on Shabbat) -> regular parasha not read,
Shavuot (when on Shabbat) -> regular parasha not read,
Rosh Hashanah (when on Shabbat) -> regular parasha not read,
Yom Kippur (when on Shabbat) -> regular parasha not read,
Sukkot (first day when on Shabbat) -> regular parasha not read]
