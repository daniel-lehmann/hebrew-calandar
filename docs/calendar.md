# Calendar

## Combined month view

The main calendar shows **one month** with both Gregorian and Hebrew information in each day cell:

- **Main line:** Gregorian day number
- **Sub line:** Hebrew day and month (e.g. *15 Nisan*)
- **Holidays:** Shown when the date is a Jewish holiday
- **Parasha:** On Saturdays, the weekly Torah portion is shown (click for details)

## Navigation

- **Month arrows (‹ ›):** Move one month back or forward
- **Year arrows (‹‹ ››):** Move one year back or forward
- **Go:** Refresh the calendar with the selected month/year
- **Hebrew View:** Switch to a Hebrew-centric view (see below)

## View toggle: Gregorian vs Hebrew

- **Gregorian view (default):** You pick month and Gregorian year. The grid is laid out by Gregorian week (Sun–Sat). Each cell shows the Gregorian date plus the corresponding Hebrew date and any holiday/parasha.
- **Hebrew view:** You pick Hebrew month and Hebrew year. The grid is laid out by the same weekdays, but the primary label in each cell is the Hebrew date; the Gregorian date is shown as secondary. Holidays and parashot work the same way.

Navigation arrows and the view toggle keep the two modes in sync (e.g. switching to Hebrew view converts the current Gregorian month to the matching Hebrew month and year).
