# Mobile and small screens

The app is **responsive**: layout and controls adapt to narrow viewports (e.g. phones).

## What changes on small screens

- **Controls** — Month, year, and buttons stack vertically so they’re easy to tap.
- **Calendar grid** — Cells become smaller; font sizes and padding are reduced so the month fits on one screen.
- **Holidays and parashot** — Text may wrap or shrink so it stays readable in the cell.
- **Stats** — Panels and inputs stack; buttons and dropdowns use full width where it helps.
- **Charts** — Graph height is reduced on very small screens (e.g. 280px) so the page doesn’t grow too long.
- **Search popup** — Uses most of the viewport width so the input and results are easy to use.
- **Navigation arrows** — Slightly smaller on very narrow screens but still tappable.

Breakpoints are set around **640px** and **380px** width so that phones and very small devices get a usable, readable layout without horizontal scrolling for normal use.
