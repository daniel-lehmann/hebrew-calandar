# Search

## Opening search

- Press **Ctrl+J** (or Cmd+J on Mac), or
- Click the **search icon** (magnifying glass) in the controls area

A search popup opens with a text field.

## What you can search for

- **Holidays** — e.g. *Pesach*, *Rosh Hashanah* — matches holiday names and jumps to a date when that holiday occurs
- **Hebrew dates** — e.g. *Kislev 22*, *15 Nisan 5786* — jumps to that Hebrew date
- **Gregorian dates** — e.g. *March 25*, *2025-03-25*, *3/25/2025* — jumps to that Gregorian date

As you type, **suggestions** appear below. Click a suggestion (or select it with the keyboard and press Enter) to jump to that date. The calendar updates to the correct month and year; if you were in Hebrew view, it stays in Hebrew view and navigates by Hebrew date.
