# Holidays

## Display

When a day is a Jewish holiday, the holiday name appears in the calendar cell (e.g. *Pesach*, *Rosh Hashanah*, *Yom Kippur*).

## Year-navigation arrows

For holiday cells, **◀** and **▶** buttons appear next to the holiday name:

- **◀:** Jump to the same holiday in the **previous** Hebrew year
- **▶:** Jump to the same holiday in the **next** Hebrew year

This works in both Gregorian and Hebrew calendar views: the app switches to the month that contains that holiday in the chosen year.

## Holidays included

The app recognizes the main holidays (e.g. Pesach, Shavuot, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Sukkot, Shemini Atzeret, Simchat Torah, Chanukah, Tu Bishvat, Purim, and others) and shows them on the correct Hebrew dates according to the calculated calendar.
