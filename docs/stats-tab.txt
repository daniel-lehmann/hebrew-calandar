Feature explanation: Stats tab
=============================

The Stats tab ("Hebrew Calendar Stats") provides tools to explore the Hebrew
calendar over many years. Use the buttons to open one of the following panels.


1. List Hebrew date by year
---------------------------
Shows a table: for each of the last N Hebrew years, the Gregorian date when
a chosen Hebrew date (or holiday) occurs.

- Choose how many years to show (e.g. 19, 50).
- Choose date type:
  - Holiday: pick a holiday (e.g. Pesach, Rosh Hashanah). The list shows
    the Gregorian date of that holiday for each year.
  - Custom Hebrew date: pick Hebrew month and day (e.g. 15 Nisan). The list
    shows the Gregorian date of that Hebrew date for each year.
- Click "Run" to see the list in the text area below.


2. Day-of-week histogram
-------------------------
Shows how often a given Hebrew date (or holiday) falls on each weekday
(Sun–Sat) over the last 2000 Hebrew years.

- Choose Holiday or Custom Hebrew date (and pick the holiday or month/day).
- Click "Show" to display a bar chart: one bar per weekday; the height is
  the number of years that date fell on that weekday.

Useful for facts like "Pesach cannot fall on Monday, Wednesday, or Friday"
(lo BaDU) — those bars will be zero.


3. Holiday line graph
---------------------
Shows how the Gregorian date of a holiday (or custom Hebrew date) changes
over Hebrew years.

- Pick a holiday (or custom Hebrew date if the option is available).
- Set the number of years (e.g. 50).
- Click "Show graph". A line chart appears: X = Hebrew year, Y = Gregorian
  day-of-year. Hover for exact date and weekday.
- If you request more years than fit on screen, a slider appears to scroll
  the time window.

19-year cycle mode:
- Click "Show specific years of cycle" to reveal checkboxes for cycle
  years 1–19.
- Use "Select All" or clear some to choose which years of the 19-year
  Metonic cycle to include.
- Click "Show cycle graph". The graph shows one line (or set of points)
  per selected cycle year, so you can compare how the holiday shifts for
  year 1 vs 7 vs 19, etc.


4. Back button
--------------
When a stat panel is open, a "← Back" button appears. Click it to close
the panel and return to the row of stat buttons.
