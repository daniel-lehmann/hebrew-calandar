# Hebrew Calendar Stats

The **Hebrew Calendar Stats** section provides tools to explore the calendar over many years.

## List Hebrew date by year

- Choose how many **years** to show (e.g. 19, 50).
- Choose **date type:**
  - **Holiday** — then pick a holiday from the list (e.g. Pesach, Rosh Hashanah). The output lists, for each year, the Gregorian date when that holiday falls.
  - **Custom Hebrew date** — then pick Hebrew month and day (e.g. 15 Nisan). The output lists the Gregorian date of that Hebrew date for each year.
- Click **Run** to see the list.

## Day-of-week histogram

Shows how often a given **Hebrew date** (or **holiday**) falls on each weekday (Sun–Sat) over the last 2000 Hebrew years.

- Choose **Holiday** or **Custom Hebrew date** (and pick the holiday or month/day).
- Click **Show** to display a **bar chart**: one bar per weekday, height = number of years that date fell on that weekday.

Useful for facts like “Pesach cannot fall on Monday, Wednesday, or Friday” (lo BaDU) — those bars will be zero.

## Holiday line graph

Shows how the **Gregorian date** of a holiday (or custom Hebrew date) changes over Hebrew years.

- Pick a **holiday** (or the app can support a custom date in this panel if wired).
- Set **years** (e.g. 50).
- Click **Show graph** — a **line chart** appears: X = Hebrew year, Y = Gregorian day-of-year. Hover for exact date and weekday.
- If you request more years than the max shown at once (e.g. 50), a **slider** appears to scroll the time window.

### 19-year cycle mode

- Click **Show specific years of cycle** to reveal checkboxes for cycle years 1–19.
- Use **Select All** / clear some to choose which years of the 19-year Metonic cycle to include.
- Click **Show cycle graph** — the graph shows one line (or set of points) per selected cycle year, so you can compare how the holiday shifts for year 1 vs 7 vs 19, etc.

## Back button

When a stat is open, a **← Back** button appears. Click it to hide the stat panel and show all stat buttons again.
