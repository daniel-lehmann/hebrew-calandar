Write a module that can do real moon computations.
Where the moon is. When is the new moon when is the full moon etc.

If the computations are avialable use computations they need to be exact to a few minutes at least.
If the computations aren't avialable then download moon times.
test your values.

Do this in a sepearate file.

Then in the stats add a graph of new moon vs the 29d 12h 793h definition.
the x axis will show month count and the y axis shows how much later the 'average month' is in hours.
show the last 50 months and add a slider to select start month and end month.
