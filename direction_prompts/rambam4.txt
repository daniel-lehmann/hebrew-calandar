The epoch is at thursday Nisan 3 4938 0 hours.
Notice the hebrew date starts from the night so this is actuall 6 in the evening on wednesday.

The sun position in the averrage motion:
7 deg 3 arcminutes 32 arcseconds

The furthest point of the sun was at:
86 deg 45 minutes 8 seconds

You need to create a page that does 3 computations.
we will be adding to these so be ready for that.

A. Allow the user to select a hebrew date. 
year, Month, day you can do this like the search you already created in the calendar.
Then allow selecting time do this is a similar search idea.
Select time. The day starts at 18:00 so monday 00:00 is sunday 18:00.

B. Comute the time passed from epoch

C. Show 3 calculations:
1. sun average place. you take the epoch and add averrage motion * time passed.
2. aphelion place. place at epoch + motion * time.
3. distance of averrage from aphelion. 2-1
4. real place of sun - use the anomal correction we already did.

remember all places are modulu 360

Default the date to saturday Tamuz 14 4938 0 hours.

Add this as another rambam calc. 
Do it in seperate files so the files stop getting bloated.
html,css, js all seperate and load it in as needed.
